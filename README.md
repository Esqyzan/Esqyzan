# 👋 Hello, Code Explorer! 

**I’m Esqyzan** (or **Esqyzan4ik** for friends), a budding programmer who believes Python, neural networks, and automation aren’t just tools—they’re *magic spells*!

*(Not me. But this cat and I share the same passion for late-night coding!)*

## 🚀 What I Do  

- 🐍 Cast **Python** spells to automate the mundane  
- 🤖 Tinker with **neural networks**—from meme generators to serious experiments  
- ⚙️ Automate *everything* (yes, even my coffee machine when GitHub throws a 418 error)  
- ☕ Fuel my code with tea (the real MVP of debugging)

## 🔥 Projects  

🚧 *Projects under construction!* 🚧  
*(Stay tuned—I’m brewing something cool! Meanwhile, check out my [repos](https://github.com/Esqyzan?tab=repositories) for chaotic experiments.)*

## 🎮 Life Beyond Code  

- Gaming in **CS2** (still a noob, but my code reflexes help… sometimes)  
- Binging anime with *subs + dubs* simultaneously (multitasking level: **overkill**)  
- Training AI to identify tea types (spoiler: it thinks chamomile is a Pokémon)
